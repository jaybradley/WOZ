		/**
		 * Publishes a News Feed story to the user corresponding to the session_key parameter.
		 * 
		 * Publishing to News Feed requires you to understand the rules of its operation.
	     * The title is required, and is limited to 60 displayed characters (excluding tags).
     	      o The <a> tag is allowed, and there can only be zero or one instance of it in the title.
         	  o No other tags are allowed. 
    	 * The body is optional, is limited to 200 displayed characters (excluding tags), and can include the tags <a>, <b>, and <i>.
    	 * Up to 4 images can be displayed, which are shrunk to fit within 75x75 pixels, cached, and formatted by Facebook. Images can either be a URL, or a facebook PID. If it is a URL, you must own the image and grant Facebook the permission to cache it. Each image must have a link associated with it, which must start with http://
    	 * Applications are limited to calling this function once every 12 hours for each user.
    	 * The story may or may not show up in the user's News Feed, depending on the number and quality of competing stories.
    	 * Developer Note: If an application developer calls feed.publishStoryToUser for his own user ID, the story is always published. This allows for testing and display tweaks.

		 * Publishes a Mini-Feed story to the user corresponding to the session_key parameter, and publishes News Feed stories to the friends of that user.
		 * 
		 * Publishing to Feeds requires you to understand the rules of their operation.
	     * The title is required, and is limited to 60 displayed characters (excluding tags).
     	      o One <a> tag is allowed.
       	      o One fb:userlink tag is allowed, and the uid parameter must be populated with the user ID on whose behalf the action is being published. If there is no such fb:userlink tag found, then one is automatically prepended to the title.
	          o The fb:name tag is allowed, and there may be multiple instances of this tag.
          	  o No other tags are allowed. 
    	 * The body is optional, is limited to 200 display characters (excluding tags), and can include the tags fb:userlink, fb:name, <a>, <b>, and <i>.

(RobRoy: PID doesn't work for me, anyone else verify?) If it is a URL, you must own the image and grant Facebook the permission to cache it. Each image must have a link associated with it, which must start with http://
    	 * Applications are limited to calling this function 10 times for each user in a rolling 48-hour window.
    	 * The story may or may not show up in the user's friends' News Feeds, depending on the number and quality of competing stories.
    	 * Developer Note: Since this method affects all Facebook friends of the developer, testing this method does abide by the limited-calling rule (unlike feed.publishStoryToUser).
