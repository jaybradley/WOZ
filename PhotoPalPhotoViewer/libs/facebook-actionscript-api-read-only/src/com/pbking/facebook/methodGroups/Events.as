		/**
		 * Returns all visible events according to the filters specified. 
		 * You can use this method to find all events for a user, or to query a 
		 * specific set of events by a list of event IDs (eids).
		 * 
		 * If both the uid and eids parameters are provided, the method returns all 
		 * events in the set of eids that are associated with the user. If no eids 
		 * parameter are specified, the method returns all events associated with the 
		 * specified user.
		 * 
		 * If the uid parameter is omitted, the method returns all events associated 
		 * with the provided eids, regardless of any user relationship.
		 * 
		 * If both parameters are omitted, the method returns all events associated with 
		 * the session user.
		 * 
		 * start_time and end_time parameters specify a (possibly open-ended) window in 
		 * which all events returned overlap. Note that if start_time is greater than or 
		 * equal to end_time, an empty top-level element is returned.
